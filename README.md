## üè¢ Business Introduction

**Mercurion Retail Group** is a multinational consumer goods company operating across diverse markets, including **North America, Europe, and Asia**. With a broad product portfolio and a customer base spanning **government, enterprise, midmarket, and small business segments**, the company has experienced **rapid expansion** over the past two years.

However, this growth has come with challenges. Inconsistent data practices and fragmented reporting structures have hindered its ability to make informed sales decisions. As competition intensified and growth began to plateau, Mercurion launched a **data-driven transformation initiative** aimed at enhancing sales performance, streamlining operations, and aligning its strategy with **insights drawn from its vast‚Äîyet previously underutilized‚Äîsales data**.

## üìà Dashboard Insights

### üîπ **Key Metrics Overview**

At the top of the dashboard, we track four essential business metrics:

- **Total Revenue**: ‚Ç¶8.26 billion  
- **Total COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**: ‚Ç¶7.08 billion  
- **Profit**: ‚Ç¶1.18 billion  
- **Units Sold**: 78.5 million  

These high-level figures reveal that while revenue is strong, **the profit margin (~14%) is relatively thin**, which may suggest rising costs or inefficiencies in supply chain management. Monitoring these top-line numbers regularly helps leadership understand the health of the business at a glance and assess the effectiveness of ongoing strategies.

---

### üìÖ **Monthly Revenue Trend**

The monthly revenue trend chart offers visibility into seasonal and strategic fluctuations in sales. A close inspection reveals that:

- Revenue was relatively flat in Q1 (January‚ÄìMarch).
- Moderate growth appeared in Q2, with a spike beginning in **September (Q3)**.
- October saw the **highest revenue peak**, possibly aligned with promotions, product releases, or holiday demand.
- Revenue dipped slightly in November, then bounced back in December.

This pattern suggests strong **seasonality in customer purchasing behavior**, particularly in the latter half of the year. Understanding this can help plan marketing campaigns, inventory stocking, and staffing levels.

---

### üèÜ **Top Performing Products**

The bar chart ranking products by revenue clearly shows **Paseo** as the top-performing product, generating over ‚Ç¶2.3 billion in revenue‚Äî**nearly 28% of all sales**. Close followers include VIT, Velo, Amarilla, Montana, and Carretera.

The steep drop after Paseo indicates that **revenue is heavily concentrated in a few products**, which poses a risk. If sales for Paseo decline due to supply disruptions or market shifts, the company could see a disproportionate dip in total revenue. 

This insight underscores the importance of both **product portfolio diversification** and strengthening the mid-tier performers (like Montana and Carretera) through strategic bundling or promotions.

---

### üì¶ **% Revenue by Product**

The donut chart reinforces the above insight with a visual distribution of each product's revenue share. While Paseo leads with 28%, other products range from 11% to 17%.

This visualization helps sales managers quickly identify which products are **critical revenue anchors** and which ones may need a **repositioning strategy**. Product cannibalization or overlapping features may also be investigated to understand why certain items lag behind.

---

### üë• **% Revenue by Customer Base**

This donut chart shows that nearly **44% of total revenue comes from the Government sector**, followed by Midmarket (16%), Enterprise (15%), and Small Business and Channel Partners with minimal contributions.

This reveals a **high dependency on a single customer segment**. While government contracts can be lucrative, they are also subject to delays, policy shifts, and political risks. The company needs to **diversify its customer mix** and reduce dependency to ensure long-term stability.

Furthermore, the underperformance of small businesses could be due to pricing, product-market fit, or lack of targeted outreach. These issues are worth investigating for growth opportunities.

---

### üë®‚Äçüíº **Revenue by Salesperson Age Category**

This chart examines performance across sales team age demographics. Salespeople in the **Youth (below 30)** and **Adult (30‚Äì45)** categories outperform their Elder and Old counterparts.

This insight suggests that **younger teams may be more agile**, digitally savvy, or better aligned with current customer engagement tactics. Conversely, older groups may benefit from additional training or tech enablement.

The organization could also experiment with **cross-generational mentoring** to balance experience with innovation, improving productivity across the board.

---

### üß© **Slicers and Filters**

The dashboard offers powerful interactivity through filters for:

- **Year**: Compare 2018 vs. 2019
- **Country**: Segment sales by Canada, Germany, Mexico, France, and the USA
- **Age Category**: Filter results based on sales team demographics
- **Segment**: Toggle between Government, Midmarket, Enterprise, etc.

These slicers empower users to drill down and **customize views for more focused decision-making**. For instance, a regional sales manager can isolate revenue from Mexico in 2019 and analyze which products performed best in that geography.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Expand Diversification Efforts**  
   Reduce overreliance on Paseo and the Government segment. Promote mid-tier products like Montana and Velo through bundles, discounts, or new use cases.

2. **Capitalize on Seasonality**  
   Plan sales initiatives and ad campaigns to align with the evident September‚ÄìOctober sales boom.

3. **Optimize Sales Team Composition**  
   Invest in youth-focused sales training while pairing experienced reps with new hires to share best practices across age groups.

4. **Strengthen Data Governance**  
   Standardize sales data entry, improve reporting infrastructure, and ensure country-by-country data consistency for better forecasting and performance tracking.

5. **Customer Segmentation Strategy**  
   Explore market-specific strategies to grow enterprise and midmarket client bases, especially in regions with low engagement.

---

## üßæ Conclusion

The **Mercurion Sales Performance Dashboard** provides a much-needed transformation of fragmented and inconsistent data into a **clear, insightful, and strategic tool** for business decision-making. Through targeted visualizations and dynamic filtering capabilities, the dashboard empowers Mercurion leadership to identify opportunities, correct inefficiencies, and drive growth.
